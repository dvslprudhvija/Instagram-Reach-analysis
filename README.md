# Instagram-Reach-analysis
A machine learning-based Instagram reach analysis and prediction project using Python. Features data preprocessing, EDA, visualization, and predictive modeling to optimize engagement strategies.
# 📊 Instagram Reach Analysis & Prediction  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing and predicting Instagram post reach** using **Python and machine learning**. By leveraging data-driven insights, it helps influencers, businesses, and marketers optimize their content strategies for better engagement.  

## 🎯 Features  
- ✅ **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Cleans and structures Instagram insights data  
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizes key engagement trends  
- ✅ **Feature Engineering** – Extracts useful attributes for prediction  
- ✅ **Machine Learning Model** – Predicts post reach based on past performance  
- ✅ **Visualization with Matplotlib** – Graphical representation of trends  

## 🏗 Tech Stack  
- 🔹 **Python**  
- 🔹 **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- 🔹 **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- 🔹 **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)  

## 📈 Model Performance  
The model is trained to predict reach using features like **likes, comments, shares, post type, hashtags, and posting time**. Performance evaluation includes **R² Score, RMSE, and MAE** to ensure accuracy.  

## 📌 How to Use  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
