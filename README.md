# Instagram-Reach-analysis
A machine learning-based Instagram reach analysis and prediction project using Python. Features data preprocessing, EDA, visualization, and predictive modeling to optimize engagement strategies.

  
# 📊 Instagram Reach Analysis & Prediction  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project analyzes and predicts Instagram post reach using **Python and machine learning**. The goal is to help influencers, businesses, and marketers optimize their content strategies by leveraging data-driven insights.  

## 🎯 Features  
- ✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Handles missing values and outliers  
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizes engagement trends with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly  
- ✅ **Word Cloud Generation** – Extracts key themes from hashtags and captions  
- ✅ **Machine Learning Model** – Implements **PassiveAggressiveRegressor** for prediction  
- ✅ **Feature Engineering** – Uses Instagram metrics like impressions, likes, comments, shares, and profile visits  

## 🏗 Tech Stack  
- 🔹 **Python**  
- 🔹 **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- 🔹 **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** (Data Visualization)  
- 🔹 **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)  
- 🔹 **NLTK, WordCloud** (Text Processing)  

## 📈 Model Performance  
The model is trained to predict post reach based on engagement features. Evaluation metrics include **R² Score, RMSE, and MAE** for accuracy assessment.  

## 📌 How to Use  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/instagram-reach-analysis.git
   cd instagram-reach-analysis
   ```  
2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
